1️⃣ Load Testing – Normal Traffic

Purpose: Check how the system performs under expected (normal) load.
Example:
👉 An online shopping site expects 1000 users during a regular sale.
You simulate those 1000 users to see if everything runs smoothly.
🧩 Goal: Make sure the site works fine under normal traffic.

🔥 2️⃣ Stress Testing – Pushing to the Limit

Purpose: Check how much load the system can handle before it crashes.
Example:
👉 The same shopping site can handle 5000 users, but you push it to 10,000–15,000 users to see when it breaks.
🧩 Goal: Find the breaking point and see how it fails (gracefully or abruptly).

⚡ 3️⃣ Spike Testing – Sudden Burst

Purpose: Check how the system behaves when traffic suddenly jumps.
Example:
👉 News site normally has 100 users, but when a viral article drops, it suddenly gets 1000 users in a minute.
🧩 Goal: See if the site crashes, slows down, or quickly recovers after the spike.

⏱️ 4️⃣ Endurance / Soak Testing – Long Run

Purpose: Check system stability over long periods of time.
Example:
👉 A video streaming site runs with 200 users continuously for 24 hours.
🧩 Goal: Detect memory leaks, slowdowns, or database issues after long use.

🌐 5️⃣ Scalability Testing – Growing Smoothly

Purpose: Check if the system can handle more load by scaling up resources.
Example:
👉 Your site handles 5k users on 3 servers. You add 3 more servers and test with 10k users.
🧩 Goal: Verify performance stays stable when the system grows.

💾 6️⃣ Volume Testing – Big Data Handling

Purpose: Check performance when dealing with large amounts of data.
Example:
👉 A cloud storage app uploads 10GB files repeatedly.
🧩 Goal: See if large data slows the system or causes errors.

🧠 One-Line Memory Trick
Type	Think Like	Goal
Load	“Normal day”	Handle expected users well
Stress	“How much can I take?”	Find breaking point
Spike	“Sudden crowd rush”	Stay stable under burst
Endurance	“Long marathon”	Stay consistent over time
Scalability	“Grow bigger smoothly”	Handle more load with more servers
Volume	“Heavy data load”	Handle huge data efficiently
