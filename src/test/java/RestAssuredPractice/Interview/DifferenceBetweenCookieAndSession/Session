[ The Technical Definition (For an Interview) ]
"A Session is a server-side mechanism used to store user information temporarily.
Since the web (HTTP) is 'stateless' and forgets the user after every click,
the Session allows the server to recognize the user across multiple page requests using a unique Session ID."


[Key Keywords to Mention]
If you are explaining this in a technical context, make sure to hit these points:

=>Server-Side: It lives on the server, not the browser.
=>Statelessness: It solves the problem of HTTP not remembering users.
=>Temporary: It is not permanent data.
=>Session ID: The unique key used to match the user to their session.

The "Phone Call" Analogy (The easiest way to visualize it)
You can compare a Session to a Phone Call:
=>Dialing (Login): You call customer service. The connection is established. This is the start of the session.
=>Talking (Activity): As long as you keep talking, the line stays open. You share information back and forth.
=>Silence (Inactivity): If you stop talking for 30 minutes, the operator hangs up to save resources. The session expires.
=>Hanging Up (Logout): You choose to end the call. The connection is severed immediately.
=>The Transcript (The Record): If the operator wrote down your complaint in their database,
that note stays there even after you hang up. That is the Record, not the Session.
