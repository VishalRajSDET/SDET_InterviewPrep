Cookies: Selenium has built-in commands:
driver.manage().getCookies();

[ The Technical Definition ]
"A Cookie is a small text file (max 4KB) stored on the client-side (the user's browser).
It is sent by the server to the browser, and then the browser sends it back to the server with every subsequent request.
Its primary purpose is to help the server remember stateful information in a stateless HTTP environment."
=========================================================================================================================


[The Real-Time Example: The "Remember Me" Checkbox]
Scenario: You log into a website (like Gmail or Facebook) and check the box that says "Remember Me." You close the browser,
restart your computer, and open the site again. You are still logged in.

[How it works technically (The Interview Explanation):]

=>[Server Response (Set-Cookie):] When you first log in successfully with "Remember Me" checked, the server sends a response header.
It doesn't just send the HTML; it includes an instruction: Set-Cookie: auth_token=XYZ_ENCRYPTED_STRING; Expires=Wed, 30 Nov 2026

=>[Browser Storage:] Your browser reads this header. It sees the Expires date is in the future. It saves this text file to your hard drive (not just RAM).

=>[Next Visit (The Request):] Three days later, you type facebook.com. Your browser checks its folder: "Do I have a cookie for facebook.com?"
Yes: It finds the cookie.
=>[Action:] It automatically adds a header to your request: Cookie: auth_token=XYZ_ENCRYPTED_STRING

[Server Verification:] The server receives the request. It reads the cookie, decrypts the token, recognizes you are John Doe,
and logs you in automatically without asking for a password.
=========================================================================================================================
[Important Security Flags (Critical for Automation/Testing)]
If you are interviewing for a QA/Automation role, you must mention these flags:

=>HttpOnly: If a cookie has this flag, it cannot be accessed by JavaScript (e.g., document.cookie).
This prevents hackers from stealing cookies using scripts (XSS attacks).

=>Note: As an automation tester using Selenium, you can still access these, but standard JavaScript on the page cannot.

=>Secure: This cookie will only be sent if the connection is encrypted (HTTPS). It won't be sent over plain HTTP.


"A Stateless Cookie works like a Name Tag. The data (like 'Language=English') is stored directly inside the cookie on the browser.
The server reads the cookie to know what to do, but it doesn't store any record of the user in its own memory.
This saves server resources but is less secure than a Session."

============================================================================================================================
1. Stateful Cookies (Session-Based): In this approach, the cookie only holds a Reference ID.
The actual data (State) is stored securely on the Server. This is like a 'Valet Ticket'—the ticket is just a claim check,
but the car is kept by the valet. This is more secure but consumes server memory.

2. Stateless Cookies (Self-Contained): In this approach, the cookie holds the Actual Data itself (often encrypted).
The server does not store any record of the user in its memory. This is like a 'Name Tag'—the user carries their own information.
This saves server memory (scalable) but requires careful encryption to prevent tampering."
