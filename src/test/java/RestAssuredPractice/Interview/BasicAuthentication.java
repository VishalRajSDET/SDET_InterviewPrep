         * I use .auth().preemptive().basic(). Alternatively, I can also manually construct the Base64 encoded header if needed,

         * Whatâ€™s the difference between .basic() and .preemptive().basic()?

         ðŸ‘‰ You can say:
         "In .basic(), Rest Assured waits until the server challenges with a 401 Unauthorized response
         before resending the request with the Basic Auth header. In .preemptive().basic(),
         credentials are sent proactively in the very first request. Preemptive auth is slightly faster
         since it avoids an extra round trip, but .basic() is more standard if the server is expected to challenge first."
         */

        /**
         * In .basic(), the client doesnâ€™t send credentials in the first request.
         When the server responds with a 401 challenge and a WWW-Authenticate header,
         the Rest Assured client automatically retries the same request but this time includes
         the Authorization: Basic <Base64> header. The client maintains the original request details in memory,
         adds the encoded credentials, and resends it transparently. In .preemptive().basic(),
         this retry step is skipped because the credentials are included proactively in the very first request

         * Follow-up Questions Interviewer May Ask
         *
         * Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between .basic() and .preemptive().basic()?
         * .basic() â†’ Sends credentials only after server challenges (401).
         * .preemptive().basic() â†’ Sends credentials immediately with the request.
         *
         * Q: Is Basic Auth secure?
         * Not secure over plain HTTP (credentials easily decoded).
         * Must use HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
         *
         * Q: Have you worked with other auth methods in Rest Assured?
         * Yes, like OAuth2 (.auth().oauth2(token)) and Bearer tokens via .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token).
