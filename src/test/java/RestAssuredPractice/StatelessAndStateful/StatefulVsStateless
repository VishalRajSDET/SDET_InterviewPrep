Analogy

Stateful: Restaurant waiter remembers you and your order every time.
Stateless: You bring a note with your order each time — waiter reads the note, doesn’t remember anything.

So the main difference:

Stateful → server remembers; request is dependent on server memory.
Stateless → server doesn’t remember; request carries all necessary info and is independently verified.
