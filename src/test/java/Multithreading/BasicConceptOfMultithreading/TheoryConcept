Concept 1: Multithreading (Thread Creation & Execution)

Real-World Meaning:

Multithreading means your program can run multiple tasks at the same time instead of waiting for one to finish.

Real SDET Use Case (Web + API)
🧠 Web Automation Example:

Let’s say you want to:

Open Chrome for 3 different users at the same time
Validate login functionality for each one simultaneously.
Normally your test would run sequentially → user1, then user2, then user3.
But with multithreading, we can make them run in parallel.

Interview Tip

“I’ve implemented multithreading in automation when I needed to execute tests concurrently —
for example, running login tests for multiple users or API calls in parallel.
I started with Java threads and later moved to ExecutorService for better management.”
