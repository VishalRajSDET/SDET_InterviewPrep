*"In my automation frameworks, multiple tests often run in parallel,
which can lead to conflicts when accessing shared resources like WebDriver,
API clients, logs, or screenshots. To handle this efficiently and safely,
I combine ThreadLocal, synchronized blocks, and ExecutorService.

For example, I use ThreadLocal to give each test thread its own WebDriver or API RequestSpecification,
ensuring that parallel threads don’t interfere with each other.
I also use synchronized blocks to protect shared resources like screenshot folders or log files —
but I keep these blocks minimal, synchronizing only the critical code that writes to the shared resource to avoid performance bottlenecks.

To run tests in parallel efficiently, I use ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool,
which manages thread reuse and concurrency. For instance, I submit multiple Selenium test tasks to the pool,
and each task uses its ThreadLocal WebDriver while synchronized blocks ensure thread-safe file writes.
Similarly, in API automation, multiple endpoints can be tested in parallel,
with ThreadLocal for per-thread request data and synchronized logging for shared reports.

This combination ensures high parallelism, thread safety, and fast execution,
which is essential for stable, scalable UI and API automation frameworks,
especially when integrated with CI/CD pipelines."*
